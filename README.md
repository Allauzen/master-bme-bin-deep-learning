# master-bme-bin-deep-learning

Five sessions of 3 hours each:
- Monday 12/10/2020 morning 
- Monday 12/10/2020 after-noon 
- Tuesday 13/10/2020 morning 
- Tuesday 13/10/2020 after-noon 


# remark
- too many things
- shorten the computation graph and provide more examples of pytorch code
- how to inspect what is learnt ? 
- suppress language modeling ? and focus on word 2 vec for unsupervised pre-training ?
