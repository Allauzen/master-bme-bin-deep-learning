    "Concerning the notebooks, you need to know that:\n",
    "- It's a set of cells, each cell has its type. **Markdown** is for text (like this one) and **code** is for python (like the next one). \n",
    "- A markdown cell can be executed to get a nice display of its content. \n",
    "- A code cell can be executed and the result (the std-output and std-err) follows the cell. \n",
    "- Cells are easy to create, delete, split, move and execute. \n",
    "- You can execute the cells in the order you want, but the consistency relies on you. \n",
    "- To help you, on the left of each code cell, it is writte, depending on what you have done so far: \n",
    "    - \"In [    ]\" : the cell has not been ran yet\n",
    "    - \"In [ 3 ]\" : this is the 3rd cell you ran\n",
    "    - \"In [ \\* ]\" : this cell is running\n",
    "    \n",
    "Behind every notebook runs a kernel (a python interpreter). When you run a code cell, that code is executed within the kernel and any output is returned back to the cell to be displayed. The kernel’s state persists over time and between cells — it pertains to the document as a whole and not individual cells.\n",
